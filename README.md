# Main Repository for Group One's Final Project.

## Selected Topic

Our project analyzes the relationship between ***GDP***/***GDP*** per capita and the productive and technological capacities of different countries between the years **2008** and **2019**.


## Selection Reasoning

As the gap between low-income and high-income countries continues to grow, it is important to understand how productive and technological capacities of countries affects the ***GDP***/***GDP*** per capita of different regional economies.


## Description of Data Sources

The data sources used for this project are derived from two reputable international organizations:
**The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)** and the **World Bank**.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- From **UNCTAD**, the data selected include the productive capacities index [(PCI)](/Data/Clean_Data/Productive_capacities_index,annual.csv) and the frontier technology readiness index [(FTRI)](/Data/Clean_Data/Productive_capacities_index,annual.csv).
- The ***PCI*** measures the level of productive capacities along three pillars for a given economy: productive resources,

entrepreneurial capabilities and production linkage. The features of the ***PCI*** analyzed for each country in this project include: human capital, natural capital, energy, transport, ICT, institutions, private sector, and structural change.

- The ***FTRI*** measures technological capacities related to physical investment, human capital and technological effort, and covers national capacities to use, adopt and adapt these technologies. The features of the ***FTRI*** analyzed for each given country in this project include: ICT, Skills, Research and Development, Industry Activity, and Access to Finance.

- From the **[World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2021&name_desc=true&start=2021)**, the data selected include countries broken by global regions and six income levels. Each country has a measurement for ***GDP per capita*** and ***GDP***: <br>
    - ***GDP per capita*** is gross domestic product divided by midyear population.<br>
    - ***GDP*** is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.


## Questions Addressed

- The main question we will address is what are the most important productive capacity and technological capacity features that a government should invest in to increase their ***GDP***/***GDP per capita***.<br>
- Another question we plan to address is how do productive capacity and technological capacity features differ between
countries in different regions of the world.


## Communication Protocols

- Slack and Zoom are utilized for communication purposes for coordination among the group's team-mates.
- Protocols were also established for correct usage by group users when utilizing GitHub.
